Hi!<br>
This repo is a home for my experiments with design. I'm trying to get a better understanding of how to make websites look good, so, I'm challenging myself to make at least one purely UI thing every week. If there's anything useful to you here, I'm more than happy for you to use it for any purpose, without attribution, as long as you don't redistribute it in its present form.

## Webpage templates

<table>
    <tr>

        <td>
            <b>Description</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <b>Link</b>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Remotio
        </td>
        <td>
            A simple, light front page with no animations
        </td>
